UFOs Sightings with JS

## Overview of Project 

Display a table showing UFO data within a JavaScript array. This website visualization has to have filters of differents criterias so the website will be very dynamic. In order to create and formatting this website I had to use JavaScript with HTML/CSS and Bootstrap.
